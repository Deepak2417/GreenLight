- Keep code complexity decent. If you cannot avoid complex code, comment it.
- Fork the repository and create a PR to the master branch, do not ask for repo access.
- Explain your pull request's changes in the description.
- Keep the documentation up to date.
- Breaking changes are possible, but need to be discussed with repo owners first. [Create an issue](https://github.com/PerhapsSomeone/GreenLight/issues/new) for this.
